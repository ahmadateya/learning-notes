* many current ciphers are block ciphers
	* better analyzed
	* broader range of applications

### Confusion vs Diffusion

* ### Feistel Cipher Structure
	* based on concept of invertible product cipher
	* its power comes from round functions
	* good explanation [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/feistel-cipher/).

* ### DES (Data Encryption Standard) Example of Feistel Cipher
	* the key size is 64 bit but the only used is 56
	* good explanation [here](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-the-des-algorithm).
