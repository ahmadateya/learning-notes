### Attacks Threatening Confidentiality
* Snooping refers to unauthorized access to or interception of data.
* Traffic analysis  refers to obtaining some other type of information by monitoring online traffic.

### Attacks Threatening Integrity
* Modification means that the attacker intercepts the message and changes it.
* Masquerading or spoofing happens when the attacker impersonates somebody else.
* Replaying means the attacker obtains a copy of a message sent by a user and later tries to replay it. 
* Repudiation means that sender of the message might later deny that she has sent the message; the receiver of the message might later deny that he has received the message.

### Attacks Threatening Availability
* Denial of service (DoS) is a very common attack. It may slow down or totally interrupt the service of a system.

A sever class of this attack is the Distributed Denial of service (DDoS) attack. In this class very large number (thousands or even millions) of attacking machines are coordinated and synchronized to attack a victim system simultaneously.
