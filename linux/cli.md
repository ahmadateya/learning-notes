# My notes from learning and using Linux

- When you run as a normal user you will find the command line separator is **$**
- When you run as a root user you will find the command line separator is **#**
- **Pwd** => show you current directory
- **~** => is the home directory
- **/** => is the root directory
- **history** [no. of commands] => to get the history of your commands
- **ctrl + r** => to search in the command history
- **uname -a** => show system and kernel
- **su - username** => change the user
- **less**
	- Displays the contents of a file or a command output, one page at a time 
	- Allows you to navigate forward and backward through the file
	- Mostly used for opening large files, as less doesn't read the entire file, which results in faster load times 
- **grep**
	- Stands for: Globally Search for Regular Expression and Print out 
	- Searches for a particular pattern of characters and displays all lines that contain that pattern
