# My notes from learning and using vim

- **There are 2 modes in vim**
    1. Default / Command mode 
    2. Insert mode

- **In command / default mode**
    - **dd** => delete a line
    - **d[number]** => to delete number of lines
    - **u** => undo changes
    - **A** => take you the end of line but takes you to insert mode
    - **$** => take you the end of line, without taking you to insert mode
    - **0** => take you the beginning of line
    - **numberG** => to go to a specific line in the file

- **In Insert mode**
    - **:set number** to enable the lines number
