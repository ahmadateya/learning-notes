# My Learning Notes :orange_book: 

I believe in this quote
> To memorize something,it's best to write it down.

So the idea is to write some learning notes to get back to it when you need it, and instead of writing in random Google Docs and sheets for my studying/reading notes, I can gather them in one place and one format that is more readable, searchable, and cool!

this is my notebook for my learning notes on any learning material.

* I write my notes inside the GitHub window to edit the files so the commit messages (most of the time) are meaningless!

## Wishlist
- start writing some blog posts about things I found useful
