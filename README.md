## My Learning Notes ðŸ““ 

I'm not a good memorizer and don't get the things until doing it myself or writing notes about it if it's something theory or saving in some place to get back to it.

The idea is instead of writing in random Google Docs and sheets for my studying notes, I can gather them in one place and one format that is more readable, searchable, and cool!

this is my notebook for taking notes on any learning material.

* I write my notes inside the GitHub window to edit the files so the commit messages is meaningless!
